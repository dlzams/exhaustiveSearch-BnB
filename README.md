# Program Comparison: Branch and Bound vs. Exhaustive Search

This repository contains three Python files implementing two optimization algorithms: Branch and Bound and Exhaustive Search. Additionally, there is a text file used for input.

## Files Overview

1. **BnB.py:**
   - Contains the implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm.

2. **ExhaustiveSearch.py:**
   - Includes the code for the Exhaustive Search algorithm, solving the same problem as in BnB.py.

3. **Compared-BnB-ES.py:**
   - Combines the Exhaustive Search and Branch and Bound programs for direct comparison. This file allows you to observe and analyze the running time and cost differences between the two algorithms.

4. **input_data.txt:**
   - A text file used for input. Save it in the same directory as the program files if you choose to use it for input.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose Input Method:**
   - When running the programs, you can either use the input data from the provided text file (`input_data.txt`) or input the data manually.

2. **Save Input Data (if using input.txt):**
   - Save `input.txt` in the same directory as the program files.

3. **Program Files:**
   - `BnB.py`: Execute this file to run the Branch and Bound algorithm.
   - `ExhaustiveSearch.py`: Run this file for the Exhaustive Search algorithm.
   - `Compared-BnB-ES.py`: Use this file to compare the performance of both algorithms.

4. **Comparison Results:**
   - The `Compared-BnB-ES.py` file displays a direct comparison between running times and costs for both algorithms. Analyze the results to understand the efficiency of each approach.
